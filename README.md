# Flappy Bird Game - README

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic game "Flappy Bird" using C programming language and the Turbo C graphics library. The game simulates the player controlling a bird, navigating it through gaps between pillars while avoiding collisions.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Install Turbo C Compiler: Ensure that you have the Turbo C compiler installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://turboc.codeplex.com/releases/view/62616).

2. Compile and Run: Open the `flappybird.c` file in the Turbo C compiler and compile and run the code. The game window should open, and you can start playing by following the on-screen instructions.

## How to Play

1. The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through gaps between the pillars without colliding with them.

2. Press the 'Y' key to make the bird flap its wings and rise upwards. Release the key to allow the bird to fall due to gravity.

3. The game continues until the bird collides with a pillar or the ground.

4. After the game is over, your score will be displayed along with the highest score achieved so far.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay mechanics.
- Randomly generated pillar heights for added challenge.
- Score tracking and display of the highest score achieved.
- Day-night cycle based on the background color.
- Sound effects for collision and game over.

## Game Controls

- Press the 'Y' key to make the bird flap its wings and rise.
- Press the 'N' key to quit the game at any time.

## Acknowledgments

This game was created as a fun coding exercise and is inspired by the original Flappy Bird game by my team.

## Notes

Please note that this code was developed using the Turbo C graphics library, which may not be compatible with modern systems. It is recommended to run the code in a suitable environment, such as DOSBox, to ensure proper execution.
